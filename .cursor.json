      "name": "JSON Viewer Lite",
      "description": "A simplified JSON viewer built with React + MobX (frontend) and FastAPI (backend). Users can upload session JSON files and visualize basic behaviors like scatter plots, heatmaps, and timelines.",
      "goals": [
        "Keep architecture simple",
        "Use only React + MobX for state management",
        "Use FastAPI as the single backend",
        "No Node.js API layer in the MVP",
        "Avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary services"

        "backend": ["FastAPI", "Pydantic", "Uvicorn"],
        "storage": "Local JSON files only"
      },
      "rules": [
        "Always keep backend under /backend and frontend under /frontend",
        "Follow clean, readable, beginner-friendly patterns",
        "Do not generate advanced backend layers unless requested",
        "Visualizations must use D3.js or heatmap.js",
        "Avoid unnecessary abstractions, factories, or complex patterns",
        "Follow REST best practices for FastAPI endpoints",
        "Reduce complexity wherever possible"
      ],
      "guidelines": [
        "When generating frontend code, prefer functional components",
        "Use MobX stores instead of Redux or Context API",
        "Write FastAPI endpoints in a simple router-based structure",
        "Keep code modular but not fragmented",
        "Prioritize clarity over architecture patterns"
